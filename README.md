This is the start of my vision of providing high quality education in India by the means of:

1. Free and open source books, written in the way highly revered books like S Chand, R C Hibbeler, The Jet Engine (Rolls Royce) are written.
2. A test interface.
3. An AI tutor, because the teacher to student ratio is too low.

I will inspire them like I wish to be inspired.
This is going to be completely free and open source, as all education should be.
